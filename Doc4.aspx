                            In order to use the semantic information in the pattern taxonomy to improve the 
                            performance of closed patterns in text mining, we need to interpret discovered 
                            patterns by summarizing them as d-patterns (see the definition below) in order 
                            to accurately evaluate term weights (supports). The rational behind this 
                            motivation is that d-patterns include more semantic meaning than terms that are 
                            selected based on a term-based technique (e.g., tf*idf). As a result, a term 
                            with a higher tf*idf value could be meaningless if it has not cited by some 
                            d-patterns (some important parts in documents). The evaluation of term weights 
                            (supports) is different to the normal term-based approaches. In the term-based 
                            approaches, the evaluation of term weights are based on the distribution of 
                            terms in documents. In this research, terms are weighted according to their 
                            appearances in discovered closed patterns.</p>

                            It is complicated to derive a method to apply discovered patterns in text 
                            documents for information filtering systems. To simplify this process, we first 
                            review the composition operation .The process of calculating d-patterns can be 
                            easily described by using the  operation in Algorithm 1 (PTM) shown in Fig. 2 
                            that will be described in the next section, where a term’s support is the total 
                            number of closed patterns that contain the term. Table 3 illustrates a real 
                            example of pattern taxonomy for a set of positive documents. We also can obtain 
                            the d-patterns of the five sample documents in Table 3 which are expressed as 
                            follows:</p>

                            To improve the efficiency of the pattern taxonomy mining, an algorithm, 
                            SPMining, was proposed in [50] to find all closed sequential patterns, which 
                            used the well-known Apriori property in order to reduce the searching space. 
                            Algorithm 1 (PTM) shown in Fig. 2 describes the training process of finding the 
                            set of d-patterns. For every positive document, the SPMining algorithm is first 
                            called in step 4 giving rise to a set of closed sequential patterns SP. The main 
                            focus of this paper is the deploying process, which consists of the d-pattern 
                            discovery and term support evaluation</p>
